Why MIT?
=======

This is a rather controversial, frequently asked question.

GPL is good for is forcing people who make changes to the source to contribute back. This would be okay if you developing a program, but never ideal for libraries or operating systems, because GPL forces any code that even remotely uses or links to the GPL source, to become GPL'd.

Since operating systems are such an integrated part of our lives, we want as little restriction as possible. Restrictive licenses are quite a big disadvantage for OS projects. MIT opens up a lot of possibilities, which are simply not plausible with, say, GPL.

GPL is upstream-centric, MIT is downstream-centric. We happen to prioritize downstream more than upstream, since downstream is what really matters: the userbase, the community, the availability.

We wanted to encourage the use, modification, and packaging of Redox in absolutely all realms. Open source should be open, for everyone. There's absolutely no reason for limiting the usage of the software. Therefore, MIT was the license of choice.
