Developers
==========

We are quite a few developers at Redox. 40+ people work on it. There are all sorts of cool people to work with.

Our [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) is Jeremy Soller ([Jackpot51](https://github.com/jackpot51)), who maintains the [kernel](https://github.com/redox-os/redox), Orbital (and [OrbTK](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk)), and the overall direction of the project.

The other side projects have different maintainers:
