Why MIT?
=======

This is a rather controversial, frequently asked question.

GPL is good for is forcing people who make changes to the source to contribute back. This would be okay if you developing a program, but never ideal for libraries or operating systems, because GPL forces any code that even remotely uses or links to the GPL source, to become GPL'd.

Since operating systems are such an integrated part of our lives, we want as little restriction as possible. Restrictive licenses are quite a big disadvantage for OS projects. MIT opens up a lot of possibilities, which are simply not plausible with, say, GPL.

GPL is upstream-centric, MIT is downstream-centric. We happen to prioritize downstream more than upstream, since downstream is what really matters: the userbase, the community, the availability.

We wanted to encourage the use, modification, and packaging of Redox in absolutely all realms. Open source should be open, for everyone. There's absolutely no reason for limiting the usage of the software. Therefore, MIT was the license of choice.

But what if someone "steals" the source code?
---------------------------------------------

We wouldn't mind if somebody did that. For successfully steal a project, you'd have to do _some_ improvements over the upstream version. You can't sell an apple for $2, if another person stands right next to you, giving them away for free. For this reason, making a (potentially proprietary) fork interesting requires to put some time and money into it.

There is nothing wrong with building on the top of Redox. You can't _unfairly_ steal a project. That's simply not possible. For a fork to gain interest, you will no matter what have to put effort into it.

Building on the top of Redox, whether it gets to upstream or not, is a thing we appreciate.

We like to have a decentralized structure of the project, allowing people to do whatever they want, no matter how they intend to share it.
