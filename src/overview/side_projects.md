Side projects
=============

You might have noticed that Redox is more than a kernel. Redox is a complete Rust operating system.

We have a number of Rust side project, which are developed for Redox, to make up a complete, functional OS:

- Orbital: The display server of Redox.
- OrbTK: A widget toolkit.
- Ion: The Redox shell.
- Sodium: A Vi-like editor.
- An implementation of ZFS.
- Oxide: Redox's package manager.

It is worth noting that all of the side-projects are pure, custom-written Rust.

We also have three different utility distributions, which are collections of small, useful command-line programs:
- Coreutils: A minimal set of utilities, which are essential for a usable system.
- Extrautils: Some extra utilities (like reminders, calendars, spellcheck, and so on).
- Binutils: Utilities for working with binary files.

Why not just use some already written programs? Because, we want a **Rust** operating system. Later, we will expand on why using Rust is important to us, and why you should care!
