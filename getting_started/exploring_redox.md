Exploring Redox
===============

Sodium
------

Sodium is Redox's Vi-like editor. In the menu-bar, pick the icon with `Na` on it. This should now open up an editor window.

A short list of the Sodium defaults:

- `hjkl`: Navigation.
- `ia`: Go to insert mode.
- `;`: Go to command-line mode.
- shift-space: Go to normal mode.

For a more extensive list, write `;help`.
