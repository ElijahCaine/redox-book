What Redox is
=============

Redox is an general purpose operating system and surrounding ecosystem written in pure Rust. Our aim is to provide a fully functioning Linux replacement, without the bad parts.

We have a modest compatibility with Linux syscalls, making Redox able to run many Linux program without any form of virtualization.

We take inspiration from Plan9, Minix, and BSD. We are trying to generalize various concepts from other systems, to get one unified design. We will speak about this some more in the `Design` chapter.

Redox runs on real hardware today.

TODO: Make this better.
